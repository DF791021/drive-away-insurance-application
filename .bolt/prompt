For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate.

Tips for the project or system prompts

Include instructions to Bolt to only change relevant code.

You goal should be to make every webpage and mobile page (clearly EVERYTHING YOU MAKE MUST BE RESPONSIVE) better looking than the best website that you can find online.
